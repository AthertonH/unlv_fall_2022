/*
    Name: Harrison Atherton, 5005662748, 1019, #7B
    Description: Program to look through a text file, organize it into an array,
    and use that array to determine the lowest temperature, highest temperature, average
    low temperature, and average high temperature
    Input: User will be prompted to enter in a file name. If the file cannot be found, 
    the user will be asked again.
    Output: The city and year will be displayed, with calculations of the lowest
    temperature, highest temperature, average low temperature, and average high 
    temperature.
